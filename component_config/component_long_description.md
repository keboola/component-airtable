Airtable Data Source allows you to download data from Airtable Bases, including custom fields selection, and filtering by
formulas. As an end user, you need to provide the Airtable API Key and the Base ID for the data you would like to
extract. The data will be exported incrementally, and you can find more information about the available resources in our
documentation.
