You must know your Airtable API key and ID of the base.

- You can obtain the API key from your [Airtable account overview page](https://airtable.com/account). Since read only access is sufficient, we recommend you create a read only account and provide its API key. For instructions how to do that, see the [this Airtable support article](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056249614).
- To obtain the base ID, open your base API documentation from the [Airtable API documentation list](https://airtable.com/api) and find the base ID in your base's API documentation.

You must also know the names of the tables in your Airtable base you want to extract. If you want to use filtering or download just a subset of the given table's fields (columns), you also need to provide the filter [formula](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) and/or the names of the fields (columns) you want to download respectively.
